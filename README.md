# MOCKSERVER EXAMPLE

### HOW TO START IT
Just do:

    scripts/run_local.sh

That's it! Give it sometime to start and then go to `http://localhost:3000` where you will see a single page with instructions on how to try it out.

To stop it, do:

    scripts/run_local.sh down

And that will shut everything down.
